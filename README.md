# DNA_Gesture
**DNA\_Gesture** is a **hand-gesture-controlled DNA sequence viewer and analyzer** that allows interactive exploration and analysis of DNA sequences using your webcam. It integrates **OpenCV, MediaPipe, and BioPython** to display DNA chunks, translate them into amino acids, identify open reading frames (ORFs), and generate GC content and codon frequency plots, all controllable with your fingers. This project is designed to make DNA sequence exploration intuitive and hands-free, ideal for learning, demonstrations, or lab-side data visualization.

The project folder includes the main Python script `dna_gesture_viewer.py`, which manages all webcam gesture detection and visualization, as well as auto-generated outputs including `gc_plot.png` for GC% plots across the sequence, `codon_bar.png` for the top 10 codon usage chart, `gene_report.html` for a clean, detailed HTML report, and `gene_summary.txt` for a quick text summary with ORFs and GC% for reference or documentation.

Using the system is straightforward. Place your `.fasta` DNA sequence file in the folder and run `python dna_gesture_viewer.py`. A file dialog will open to let you select your FASTA file, after which your webcam will activate for gesture-based navigation. You can use one finger to move to the next DNA chunk, two fingers to move to the previous chunk, three fingers to display the GC% of the current chunk, four fingers to export a detailed HTML report, and five fingers to save a quick summary text file. You can press the `h` key to show or hide the gesture guide overlay and `q` or `ESC` to exit the program at any time.

The system visually displays DNA bases in color (blue for A, pink for T, green for G, and purple for C) alongside their translated amino acid sequences. It also shows detected ORFs with their positions and translated amino acid sequences, providing a live, interactive exploration experience. Automated plots of GC content and codon usage are generated and displayed, making it easy to understand the sequence composition during navigation.

To run the project, you need Python 3.8 or higher, a webcam, and the following dependencies: `opencv-python`, `mediapipe`, `biopython`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `tkinter` (which comes preinstalled with Python). You can install all dependencies using `pip install opencv-python mediapipe biopython matplotlib numpy`.

This project is well-suited for **bioinformatics education, hands-free sequence analysis while working in the lab, interactive workshops, or gesture-controlled UI experiments in computational biology**. It helps students and researchers understand DNA composition, amino acid translation, and ORF identification in a visually engaging and memorable way.

Feel free to use, modify, and extend this project for learning and personal research. For any publication or professional use, please credit **Rushabh Wakade** as the author. Contributions are welcome, and suggestions for enhancements such as motif search, advanced ORF filtering, or integration with protein property prediction are encouraged.

If you would like, I can prepare a **repository cover image, a badge summary section for GitHub, or convert your `dna_gesture1.mp4` into a GIF** for embedding in your README to enhance your projectâ€™s presentation for your GitHub or portfolio. Let me know whenever you are ready for the next step.
